# BreastCancer-Prediction

In this breast cancer research study, the aim was to utilize machine learning techniques for prediction and early diagnosis of breast cancer. Three machine learning techniques, namely **k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest classifier, and decision tree classifier (DT)**, were compared in terms of their accuracy. The research was conducted in the anaconda environment using Python. The results showed that the k Neighbors classifier achieved an accuracy of **88.3%**, the decision tree classifier had an accuracy of **91.81%**, and the random forest classifier performed the best with an accuracy of **94.15%**. 

The study also evaluated the performance based on various metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate, false negative rate, and F1 score. The findings highlight the potential of machine learning in improving the prediction and early detection of breast cancer, which can significantly contribute to enhancing the overall treatment outcomes and ensuring a healthier life for individuals.
